IMPORTANT NOTE:
To facilitate public access to model methods while preserving data confidentiality 
and limiting analytical validity, we applied stochastic input data perturbation, 
adding non-systematic noise to key parameters. This approach renders the output 
epidemiologically non-actionable while retaining internal consistency for 
methodological replication.

All country-specific files (e.g. with tag BEL, ENG, ...) that are perturbed are 
marked with an X after the ISO3 code (e.g. BELX, ENGX, ...).
